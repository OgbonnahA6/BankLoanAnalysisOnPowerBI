# BANK LOANS ANALYSIS



### Overview

This project is dedicated to the analysis of bank loan data with the objective of deriving comprehensive insights into loan portfolio performance, customer behavior, and risk assessment. Utilizing SQL for sophisticated data processing and Power BI for advanced visualization, the analysis is designed to provide actionable intelligence on loan repayment trends, default probabilities, and customer segmentation. By embedding data-driven decision-making into operational strategies, the bank can refine its lending practices, effectively manage risk, and significantly enhance overall financial performance.

### Bank Loan Domain Knowledge
Bank loan domain knowledge encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of loan management, including loan types, underwriting processes, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance. This knowledge includes familiarity with loan products such as personal, mortgage, auto, and business loans, as well as the criteria for approving and managing these loans. It involves an understanding of credit scoring, interest rates, repayment schedules, and default management. Proficiency in this domain also requires insight into the financial metrics and performance indicators used to evaluate loan portfolios, customer behavior, and overall risk exposure. Mastery of these elements enables effective decision-making, strategic planning, and optimization of lending practices within the banking sector.

#### How do Banks Collect Loan Data?
Banks collect loan data through various channels, including loan applications, credit reports, income verification, collateral evaluation, and online platforms.

#### Process of Granting a Loan
The process of granting a loan typically involves the following steps: application, documentation, credit assessment, underwriting, approval, loan agreement, funding, loan servicing, risk management, and closure.

#### Reasons for Analyzing Bank Loan Data
Analyzing loan data is crucial for banks as it enhances several key areas of their operations. Firstly, it strengthens risk management by providing insights into potential default risks and loan performance, allowing banks to implement preventative measures and manage their risk exposure effectively. Secondly, it supports informed decision-making by offering data-driven insights into loan portfolios, enabling more strategic planning and targeted interventions. Performance monitoring is also significantly improved, as banks can track various metrics related to loan repayment and portfolio health, identifying trends and areas for improvement. Additionally, loan data analysis plays a critical role in fraud detection by uncovering anomalies and patterns indicative of fraudulent activity, thus safeguarding the institutionâ€™s assets. Finally, it provides valuable customer insights, helping banks understand borrower behavior and preferences, which can enhance customer relationship management and tailor financial products to meet customer needs more effectively.
